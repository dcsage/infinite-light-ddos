# FBI 

the fbi have seized https://cryptostresser.com 
this will no longer work

# infinite-light-ddos
Infinitely ddos a site with a 20gbps stresser
# Usage

- Sign up for an account at https://cryptostresser.com/ (30 seconds literally)
- normally you have to re-start the attack every 180 seconds, this can be stressful and hard to keep track of.

- This will automatically restart the attack on the desired user without intefering with work you're currently doing
- it will stay minimised and make sure your attack is constantly going

- note this currently only works on websites with light protection for example most school websites.
- I'll update / add more to this when i feel like it

- it has a 20 GBPS capacity

# setup

- make sure you install selenium chrome driver here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
- put it in the same folder as your main file
- double click main.py :)

you must do these in your cmd prompt:

- pip install selenium
- pip install requests
- pip install colorama

Anyway, its pretty useful as it'll do everything, and you can keep it minimised so it wont intefere with work.
